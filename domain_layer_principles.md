# Core Principles for Domain Layer Design and Implementation

This document outlines the core principles for designing and implementing a domain layer, based on the ArchitectCodeGen persona. These principles aim to create a robust, maintainable, and understandable domain model.

## 1. Dom√§nen-Modellierung (Domain Modeling)

The foundation of a strong domain layer lies in accurately and precisely modeling the problem domain.

*   **Precise Abstractions:**
    *   Identify and define core **Entities** that have a distinct identity and lifecycle.
    *   Define **Relationships** between entities, specifying cardinality and direction.
    *   Establish **Invariants:** business rules that must always hold true for entities and aggregates.
    *   Utilize **Value Objects** for concepts that are defined by their attributes and are immutable.
*   **Detailed Attributes (for Entities and Value Objects):**
    *   **Name:** A clear and descriptive name for the attribute.
    *   **Rust Type:** The specific Rust data type (e.g., `String`, `u64`, `Vec<T>`, custom types).
    *   **Visibility:** Control access using Rust's visibility modifiers (e.g., `pub`, `pub(crate)`).
    *   **Mutability:** Specify if the attribute can be changed after creation (e.g., `mut` or immutable by default).
    *   **Initial Value/Default:** Define how the attribute is initialized or its default value, if any.
    *   **Description:** A clear explanation of the attribute's purpose and meaning in the domain.
*   **Detailed Methods (for Entities and Domain Services):**
    *   **Signature:** The complete Rust function signature, including generic parameters, input parameters (name and type), and return type.
    *   **Description:** A comprehensive explanation of what the method does, its responsibilities, and its role in the domain logic.
    *   **Pre-conditions:** Conditions that must be true before the method can be executed.
    *   **Post-conditions:** Conditions that will be true after the method has successfully executed.

## 2. Modularisierung & Schnittstellen (Modularization & Interfaces)

A well-modularized domain layer with clear interfaces is crucial for maintainability and scalability.

*   **Clear, Coherent, and Stable Interfaces:**
    *   Design interfaces (often as Rust **Traits**) that are focused, easy to understand, and unlikely to change frequently.
    *   Interfaces should encapsulate a coherent set of responsibilities.
*   **Explicit Contracts for Interface Methods:**
    *   **Signature:** Precise definition of the method's name, parameters (name and type), and return type.
    *   **Parameters:** Clear description of each parameter's purpose and expected values.
    *   **Return Type:** Clear description of the returned value and its meaning.
    *   **Pre-conditions:** Conditions that must be met by the caller.
    *   **Post-conditions:** Guarantees made by the implementer upon successful completion.
    *   **Error Types:** Clearly define the specific error types (e.g., custom enums) that the method can return.
*   **Loose Coupling and High Cohesion:**
    *   **Loose Coupling:** Modules should depend on each other as little as possible, primarily through well-defined interfaces.
    *   **High Cohesion:** Elements within a module should be closely related and focused on a single area of responsibility.

## 3. Clean Code Principles

Adherence to clean code principles ensures the domain logic is readable, understandable, and maintainable.

*   **Self-documenting, Idiomatic Code:**
    *   Write code that is clear and easy to understand without extensive comments.
    *   Leverage Rust's features and conventions to write idiomatic Rust code.
    *   Use meaningful names for variables, functions, types, and modules.
*   **Adherence to SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI:**
    *   **SOLID:**
        *   **S**ingle Responsibility Principle: Each module or type should have one reason to change.
        *   **O**pen/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
        *   **L**iskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
        *   **I**nterface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
        *   **D**ependency Inversion Principle: Depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
    *   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid duplication of code and logic.
    *   **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Prefer simpler solutions over complex ones.
    *   **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):** Implement only the functionality that is currently required.

## 4. Typsicherheit & Validation (Type Safety & Validation)

Ensuring data integrity and correctness through strong typing and validation.

*   **Strict Type Safety:**
    *   Leverage Rust's strong, static type system to catch errors at compile time.
    *   Use specific types to represent domain concepts accurately (e.g., newtypes, enums).
*   **Input Validation using Type Systems and Contracts:**
    *   Validate inputs at the boundaries of the domain layer (e.g., in application services or when creating Value Objects/Entities).
    *   Use the type system itself for validation where possible (e.g., `NonEmptyString` type).
    *   Enforce invariants through constructors and methods that modify state.
*   **Definition of Validation Rules:**
    *   Clearly define and document validation rules for attributes and operations.
    *   These rules should be derived from business requirements.

## 5. Fehlerbehandlung (Error Handling)

Implementing robust and informative error handling is critical for a resilient domain layer.

*   **Robust Error-Handling Strategies:**
    *   Employ Rust's `Result<T, E>` for operations that can fail.
    *   Avoid panics for recoverable errors in domain logic.
*   **Specific Error Enums:**
    *   Define custom error enums for different failure scenarios within the domain.
    *   Use libraries like `thiserror` to create descriptive and ergonomic error types.
    *   Provide context with errors to aid in debugging and understanding.
*   **Recovery Mechanisms (where applicable):**
    *   Define strategies for how the system or user might recover from specific domain errors, if possible.
*   **Detailed Error Enums per Module:**
    *   Each domain module should define its own specific error types relevant to its operations, promoting clarity and modularity in error handling.

## 6. Algorithmische Exzellenz (Algorithmic Excellence - as applicable to domain logic)

While not always the primary focus of all domain logic, efficiency can be important for certain operations.

*   **Efficient Algorithms for Domain Logic:**
    *   When domain operations involve complex computations or data manipulation, select or design algorithms that are efficient in terms of time and space complexity relevant to the expected scale.
*   **Step-by-step, Detailed Representation of Logic:**
    *   For complex domain logic or algorithms, document the logic clearly.
    *   This can be in the form of **Pseudocode** or **precise prose** integrated into code comments or design documents.

## 7. Security by Design (as applicable to domain logic)

Integrating security considerations directly into the design of the domain layer.

*   **Systematic Integration of Security Measures:**
    *   Consider security implications relevant to the domain logic from the outset.
    *   This includes protecting business rules and data integrity.
*   **Identification of Potential Risks and Mitigation Measures per Domain Component:**
    *   For each entity, aggregate, or domain service, identify potential domain-specific security risks (e.g., unauthorized state changes, invariant violations, data corruption).
    *   Define and implement mitigation measures within the domain logic itself.
*   **Domain-Level Security Focus:**
    *   Prioritize ensuring **invariants** are always maintained.
    *   Guarantee **data integrity** through validation and controlled state transitions.
    *   Prevent **unauthorized state transitions** by encapsulating logic within entities and services and exposing only valid operations.
    *   This is distinct from infrastructure security (e.g., authentication, network security), focusing instead on the inherent security of the business logic.
