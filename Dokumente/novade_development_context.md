# NovaDE Project Development Context and Prompts

## Project Overview
NovaDE is a modern desktop environment built with Rust, designed to be modular, thread-safe, and user-friendly. The project follows a layered architecture with Core, Domain, System, and UI layers.

## Implementation Status

### Fully Implemented Components
- **Core Layer**: Complete implementation of error handling, logging, configuration, and utilities
- **Domain Layer**: Complete implementation of workspace management, theming, notifications, settings, AI interactions, and power management
- **System Layer (Partial)**:
  - Window Management: Fully implemented
  - Display Management: Fully implemented
  - Input Management: Fully implemented
  - Notification Integration: Fully implemented
  - Theme Integration: Fully implemented
  - Settings Storage: Fully implemented
  - Power Management: Fully implemented
  - Audio Management: Fully implemented
  - Network Management: Fully implemented
- **UI Layer**: Complete implementation of desktop UI, panel UI, window manager UI, application launcher, and settings UI

### Partially Implemented Components
- **System Layer - Compositor**: Skeleton implementation only
  - Core module structure is in place
  - Error handling is defined
  - Thread safety validation utilities are implemented
  - Interface definitions for all components are complete
  - Actual functionality behind the interfaces is not implemented

## Development Prompts

### Compositor Implementation
To continue development of the compositor:

1. **Implement Core Functionality**:
   ```
   Implement the actual functionality for the compositor core module, focusing on the DesktopState implementation and client data management. Ensure all methods are thread-safe and properly handle errors.
   ```

2. **Implement XDG Shell Protocol**:
   ```
   Complete the XDG shell protocol implementation in the compositor, implementing all handler methods in the XdgShellHandler trait. Ensure proper window management and state tracking.
   ```

3. **Implement Layer Shell Protocol**:
   ```
   Complete the layer shell protocol implementation in the compositor, implementing all handler methods in the LayerShellHandler trait. Ensure proper surface management for panels, docks, and other layer shell clients.
   ```

4. **Implement Renderers**:
   ```
   Complete the DRM/GBM and Winit renderer implementations, ensuring proper rendering of surfaces and textures. Implement all methods in the FrameRenderer trait.
   ```

5. **Implement Surface Management**:
   ```
   Complete the surface management implementation, ensuring proper handling of surface commits, buffer attachments, and damage tracking.
   ```

6. **Implement Initialization**:
   ```
   Complete the compositor initialization functions, ensuring proper setup of the desktop state, renderers, and signal handlers.
   ```

7. **Add Comprehensive Tests**:
   ```
   Add unit tests for all compositor components, ensuring proper functionality and thread safety. Include integration tests for component interactions.
   ```

### Integration with Existing Components

1. **Integrate with Window Management**:
   ```
   Integrate the compositor with the existing window management module, ensuring proper communication between the two components.
   ```

2. **Integrate with Display Management**:
   ```
   Integrate the compositor with the existing display management module, ensuring proper handling of multiple monitors and display configuration changes.
   ```

3. **Integrate with Input Management**:
   ```
   Integrate the compositor with the existing input management module, ensuring proper handling of keyboard, mouse, and touch input.
   ```

### Additional Wayland Protocols

1. **Implement Additional Protocols**:
   ```
   Implement additional Wayland protocols such as primary selection, data device, and presentation time to enhance the compositor's functionality.
   ```

## Thread Safety Considerations

All components must be thread-safe, using appropriate synchronization primitives:
- Use `Arc` for shared ownership
- Use `Mutex` for exclusive access
- Use `RwLock` for reader-writer patterns
- Avoid deadlocks by establishing a consistent lock ordering
- Use interior mutability only with proper synchronization

## Error Handling Guidelines

- Use `thiserror` for error definitions
- Ensure proper error propagation
- Preserve context in errors
- Handle all error cases gracefully

## Documentation Guidelines

- Document all modules, structs, and functions
- Include examples where appropriate
- Document thread safety considerations
- Document error handling

## User-Friendliness Priority

When making design decisions, always prioritize what is best for the user. The goal is absolute user-friendliness.

## Final Steps

1. **Complete Compositor Implementation**:
   ```
   Complete the implementation of all compositor components, ensuring thread safety, proper error handling, and comprehensive documentation.
   ```

2. **Validate Implementation**:
   ```
   Validate the implementation against the project specifications, ensuring all requirements are met.
   ```

3. **Update Documentation**:
   ```
   Update all project documentation to reflect the completed implementation.
   ```

4. **Create Final Project Package**:
   ```
   Create a final project package with all source code, documentation, and tests.
   ```
