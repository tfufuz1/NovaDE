## Test Coverage

All modules have been implemented with comprehensive unit tests to ensure functionality works as expected. The test coverage includes:

- Basic functionality tests
- Edge case handling
- Error condition testing
- Integration between components

## API Design

The System Layer APIs have been designed with the following principles:

1. **Consistency**: All APIs follow consistent naming and parameter conventions
2. **Ergonomics**: APIs are designed to be intuitive and easy to use
3. **Flexibility**: APIs provide appropriate extension points for future enhancements
4. **Documentation**: All public APIs are thoroughly documented

## Error Handling

Error handling has been implemented using the `thiserror` crate as specified in the core layer. Each module defines its own error types that implement the `Error` trait, providing:

- Clear error messages
- Proper error categorization
- Context information where appropriate
- Integration with the logging system

## Performance Considerations

The System Layer implementation has considered performance in the following ways:

1. Efficient data structures for frequently accessed data
2. Asynchronous APIs for potentially blocking operations
3. Caching of expensive system queries
4. Lazy loading where appropriate

## User Experience

The System Layer has been implemented with user experience as a priority:

1. Intuitive APIs that follow the principle of least surprise
2. Comprehensive error messages that guide users toward solutions
3. Default values that provide a good out-of-box experience
4. Flexibility to customize behavior to user preferences

## Conclusion

The System Layer implementation meets all the requirements specified in the project documentation. It provides concrete implementations of the interfaces defined in the Domain Layer, interacting with the underlying operating system and hardware. The code is clean, well-tested, and well-documented.

## Next Steps

The next phase of the project will involve implementing the UI Layer, which will build upon the System Layer to provide a graphical user interface for the NovaDE Desktop Environment.
