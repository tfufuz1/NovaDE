## Overall Assessment

The Core Layer modules have been thoroughly validated and meet all criteria for correctness, usability, and user-friendliness. The API design is consistent across modules, with clear documentation and comprehensive test coverage.

The error handling is robust, with clear error messages and appropriate error types for different scenarios. Default values and sensible configurations ensure that the system works well out of the box, enhancing user-friendliness.

## Next Steps

1. Proceed with the implementation of the Domain Layer modules
2. Ensure the same level of quality and user-friendliness in all subsequent modules
3. Maintain comprehensive documentation and test coverage throughout the project
