[features]
default = []
# The enable-libinput-integration feature is removed as the dependencies are gone.
# If this feature flag was used for other purposes in the .rs files, those #[cfg] attributes
# will now effectively be false, which should be fine as we are providing pure stubs.
# For a clean slate, it's better to remove it if its only purpose was for the removed deps.
# If other parts of the code were using #[cfg(feature = "enable-libinput-integration")],
# they will now use their #[cfg(not(feature = "enable-libinput-integration"))] paths,
# which is the intended outcome for a pure stub implementation.

# Conditional dependency sections for libinput/udev are also removed.
