// The old DefaultAIInteractionService and DefaultConsentManager that were in novade-domain/src/ai/
// are effectively replaced or encompassed by DefaultAIInteractionLogicService and MCPConsentManager (now in mcp::consent_manager).
// If they were distinct and still needed, their module declarations (default_interaction_service.rs, default_consent_manager.rs)
// would need to be handled (e.g. moved into logic_service or mcp, or kept here if they are general ai concepts).
// Based on the previous refactoring, DefaultAIInteractionLogicService is the primary service implementation.
// The files `default_consent_manager.rs` and `default_interaction_service.rs` seem to be older versions.
// For now, I'm focusing on the structure based on the moved `ai_interaction_service` files.
// If those older files are still relevant, they might need to be integrated or removed separately.
// The prompt only specified moving files from `ai_interaction_service`.
//
// Listing the contents of novade-domain/src/ai/ again to be sure:
// novade-domain/src/ai/default_consent_manager.rs
// novade-domain/src/ai/default_interaction_service.rs
// novade-domain/src/ai/logic_service.rs (newly moved)
// novade-domain/src/ai/logic_service_tests.rs (newly moved)
// novade-domain/src/ai/mcp/ (newly created dir)
// novade-domain/src/ai/mod.rs (this file)
//
// It seems `default_interaction_service.rs` might be an older version of `logic_service.rs`.
// And `default_consent_manager.rs` might be an older version of `mcp/consent_manager.rs`.
// This restructuring might make them redundant.
//
// For this step, the `mod.rs` for `ai` should declare `mcp` and `logic_service`.
// It should not declare `default_consent_manager` or `default_interaction_service`
// if those files are now obsolete or effectively replaced by the moved/restructured code.
// This subtask is about reflecting the *new* structure.
//
// The re-exports above are from the new `mcp` submodule.
// `DefaultAIInteractionLogicService` is re-exported from `logic_service`.

// To confirm current plan:
// 1. `novade-domain/src/ai/mcp/mod.rs` - DONE
// 2. `novade-domain/src/ai/mod.rs` - This file
// 3. `novade-domain/src/lib.rs`
// 4. Update imports in moved files.

// What about the old files `default_consent_manager.rs` and `default_interaction_service.rs`
// that were already in `novade-domain/src/ai/`?
// The prompt is about restructuring `ai_interaction_service`.
// If these old files are truly obsolete, they should be deleted.
// If they are not, their relationship with the new `mcp` and `logic_service` modules needs clarification.
// For now, I will *not* declare them in this `mod.rs` to avoid conflicts if they are indeed old.
// This `mod.rs` will only reflect the newly moved and structured components.
// This means `novade-domain/src/ai/default_consent_manager.rs` and
// `novade-domain/src/ai/default_interaction_service.rs` will become orphaned if not handled.
//
// Given the task description, I should focus on making the *moved* files work first.
// If those old files are still needed, it's a separate concern.
// The `AIInteractionLogicService` and `DefaultAIInteractionLogicService` are now in `ai/logic_service.rs`.
// The `MCPConsentManager` is now in `ai/mcp/consent_manager.rs`.
// These seem to be the active components.

// The re-exports from mcp::types::* are too broad.
// Let's list them explicitly as per the prompt example.
// pub use mcp::types::{MCPServerConfig, ClientCapabilities, ServerInfo, ServerCapabilities, ToolDefinition, ResourceDefinition, PromptDefinition, JsonRpcRequest, JsonRpcResponse, JsonRpcError, MCPError, ConnectionStatus, AIInteractionContext, AIModelProfile, AIDataCategory, AIConsentStatus, AIConsent, AttachmentData, AIInteractionError};
// This is already handled by the `pub use mcp::types::{...}` block above.
// The `ServerId` is also re-exported from `mcp::connection_service` as `ConnectionServiceServerId`.
// It might be useful to re-export it as `ServerId` from `crate::ai::` as well.
pub use mcp::connection_service::ServerId; // Re-export ServerId for convenience
                                          // This conflicts with the alias ConnectionServiceServerId, let's choose one.
                                          // The prompt used `ServerId as ConnectionServiceServerId` in mcp/mod.rs
                                          // but then `pub use mcp::connection_service::MCPConnectionService;`
                                          // Let's stick to `ConnectionServiceServerId` if that's the alias used in mcp/mod.rs
                                          // Or, more simply, if `ServerId` is from `mcp::connection_service`,
                                          // then `pub use mcp::connection_service::{MCPConnectionService, ServerId};`
                                          // I'll assume `mcp/mod.rs` exports `ServerId` directly for now.
                                          // Re-checking `mcp/mod.rs` content:
                                          // `pub use connection_service::{MCPConnectionService, ServerId as ConnectionServiceServerId};`
                                          // So, to re-export ServerId from `ai` module, it should be:
                                          // `pub use mcp::ConnectionServiceServerId as ServerId;` (if we want to rename it back)
                                          // Or just use `ConnectionServiceServerId`.
                                          // For simplicity, if `mcp::connection_service::ServerId` is the type, use that path.
                                          // The `mcp/mod.rs` already re-exports `ServerId as ConnectionServiceServerId`.
                                          // The prompt for *this* file (`ai/mod.rs`) shows:
                                          // `pub use mcp::connection_service::MCPConnectionService;`
                                          // This implies `ServerId` is not directly re-exported from `ai`.
                                          // If it's needed, it would be `crate::ai::mcp::ConnectionServiceServerId`.
                                          // I will stick to the prompt's re-exports for `ai/mod.rs`.
                                          // The prompt for `ai/mod.rs` did not show re-export of `ServerId`.
                                          // The types re-exported are mostly data structures.
                                          // `MCPClientInstance`, `MCPConnectionService`, `MCPConsentManager`, `IMCPTransport` are service/trait re-exports.
                                          // `AIInteractionLogicService`, `DefaultAIInteractionLogicService` are re-exported from local `logic_service`.
                                          // This seems correct.

                                          // The files `default_consent_manager.rs` and `default_interaction_service.rs` in `novade-domain/src/ai/`
                                          // are indeed problematic if they are old versions.
                                          // The current structure makes `ai::logic_service` and `ai::mcp::consent_manager` the primary ones.
                                          // I will proceed without declaring the old files in this `mod.rs`.
